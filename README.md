# Movie Catalogue

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

<hr />

## Project Set-Up

This project uses [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) APIs in order to fetch and store movie data. In order to successfully run the project, you will need to generate API keys for both, and attach them to a `environments.ts` file in the project directory. See `src/environments/environments.example.md` for more info pertaining to the set-up of the file.

<br />

### **Generating TMDB API Key**

To get movie data from TMDB, an API key is needed. This can be achieved through first creating an account on [their website](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US). After an account has been created, select API from the menu on the account settings page, and create an app. After succesful creation, an API key for requests to the TMDB API can be found in the app overview section. Add it to your `environments.ts` file!

<br />

### **Generating Firebase Project and Auth Key**

This project was originally set-up with a Firebase backend. To replicate the original set-up, one can add a new project from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). A google account is needed to log in.
\
\
Once the project has been initialized, two steps are required: Generating an API key used for user authentication and sign-up, and creating a Realtime Database. The web API key can be generated by naviagting to Authentication in the Project menu and adding email/password authentication to the project. After authentication has been added to the project, a web API key used for user authentication and sign-up can be found in the project settings tab. Add it to `environments.ts`!
\
\
The newly created project can be configured with Firebase's [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/start) service, follow the steps necessary to set one up for the newly created project. Make sure the project rules are intially set to test mode for the app to function (can be updated as described below). A link for making REST API calls will be created once the Realtime Database is set up. Copy the base link and add it to your `environments.ts` file. 
\
\
Optionally, the rules for the newly created Realtime database can be updated to ensure further security. From the rules tab on the project's realtime database, the following can be copied:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        // grants write access to the owner of this user account
        // whose uid must exactly match the key ($userId)
        ".write": "$userId === auth.uid",
        ".read" : "$userId === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
